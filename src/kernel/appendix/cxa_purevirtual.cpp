// This file provides an implementation of the `__cxa_pure_virtual` function, 
// which is part of the C++ ABI (Application Binary Interface). This function 
// is called when a pure virtual function is invoked on an object that has not 
// been fully constructed or properly initialized.

// In C++, pure virtual functions are declared in abstract base classes and 
// must be overridden by derived classes. If a pure virtual function is called 
// directly (e.g., due to a programming error or misuse of an object), the 
// runtime calls `__cxa_pure_virtual` as a fallback.

// This function must exist to satisfy the linker and provide a defined behavior 
// when such an error occurs. In this implementation, the function is empty, 
// meaning it does nothing. However, in a complete system, it might log an error, 
// terminate the program, or provide debugging information.
